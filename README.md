Issue with types: remove package.json "exports" as workaround


Issues:
- Looks like you've put in a work address:
  - (Dan to surface into summary)
  - 
  "Will you always have access to this email/is this a biz email?"
  "Using a personal email allows access even after changing jobs"
  - Checkbox confirming email , cchecking adds new text field for personal email

- Use the example for the warning step when a business email is supplied (also hides next/prev)

- Use the animation on the next button when calling the api
